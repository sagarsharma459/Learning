Binding and mutability
1) ðŸŒŸ A variable can be used only if it has been initialized.


// Fix the error below with least amount of modification to the code

    
    fn main() {
    let x: i32 = 5; // Uninitialized but used, ERROR !
    let _y: i32; // Uninitialized but also unused, only a Warning !

    assert_eq!(x, 5);
    println!("Success!");
    }
  
    
    Success!
    
    Solution : To remove Error initialize x = 5; and to remove warning put _(underscore before y).
    
  2) ðŸŒŸ Use mut to mark a variable as mutable.
        
            // Fill the blanks in the code to make it compile
            
            fn main() {
                        let mut x =  1;
                        x += 2; 
    
                        assert_eq!(x, 3);
                         println!("Success!");
                     }
                    
            Success!
          Solution : use mut keyword and fill balnk with x varible.

Scope
A scope is the range within the program for which the item is valid.
